Hi, this is the first project for ELEC5307.
Hangyu Chen (490075948)

The aim of this project is for us to get familar with the training process and choosing optimal hyperparameters. 

1. The project1.ipynb file is where I put my model and results+analysis in.

2. The project1.py + baseline.pth + modified.pth files are what we need for part3.

3. The Untitled0.ipynb file is where I used to train my baseline and modified model in part3.
